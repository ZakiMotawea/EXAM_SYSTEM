# EXAM_SYSTEM ( ITI Graduation Project ) 
created an exam system for ITI students based on a business scenario. To implement this system, I used various Python libraries to generate data and create a database. I also designed an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and mapped it to a database schema. Additionally, I developed stored procedures in SQL Server to handle operations such as adding, updating, deleting, and searching data in the database.

Furthermore, I built a data warehouse using SQL Server and the SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) tool. Within the data warehouse, I implemented a star schema to optimize data retrieval and analysis. I also utilized SSAS (SQL Server Analysis Services) to calculate cubes and measures for multidimensional analysis. To present the data and insights obtained from the system, I employed SSRS (SQL Server Reporting Services) for reporting functionality.

Finally, I leveraged Power BI to perform data modeling and create interactive dashboards. These dashboards provide visualizations and enable users to gain valuable insights from the data.
